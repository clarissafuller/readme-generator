# README Generator

## Description

When creating an open source project on GitHub, it’s important to have a high-quality README for the app. This should include what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions—this last part increases the likelihood that other developers will contribute to the success of the project.

You can quickly and easily generate a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project.

The goal of this homework was to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package.

## Installation

- Start by cloning down the github repo using the SSH or HTTPS links
- Once on your machine, to start the application you will need to open a new terminal in your README-generator folder
- run npm start in the command line

Your app should start now!

## Usage

[Link to Usage Video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dIDwA3LPn8q4pJpqxEam1np3GUOL6kGK/view?usp=sharing)

This command-line app is used to generate README files. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project.

Once the app is started, the command line will ask a series of questions that you should fill out thoroughly to create the best README file possible.

After you finish the prompts, the README file should generate right in your current folder that your terminal is open in.
